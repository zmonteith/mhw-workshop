# Marine Heatwaves and extreme events
This repository contains data and code for the MEPG 2024-12 meeting.

Time series of SST and salinity from BC Coast light stations, and a subset of Nearshore subtidal sites are found in the `raw-data` directory.

R code for producing climatologies from the included data are found in the `scripts` directory. The file `tempLoggersNearshore.R` is for reformatting temporature data, but shouldn't be need as an updated and properly formatted version of the temperature data package is now available in the respective repository [here](https://github.com/HakaiInstitute/nearshore-standalone-temperature).
